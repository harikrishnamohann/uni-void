# Uni-Void
> A sliding puzzle game inside your terminal

Hey all! This is a super simple tui-based game that I made for learning purposes. Let me explain what the game is. You're presented with an nÃ—n matrix with shuffled numbers and one empty tile. you are tasked with sorting the matrix in ascending order by sliding that empty tile around inside the matrix. You can choose a difficulty at the beginning and a leaderboard is displayed on game completion. That's all!
