# Uni-Void
> A sliding puzzle game inside your terminal

Hey all! This is a super simple tui-based game that I made for learning purposes. Let me explain what the game is. You're presented with an nÃ—n matrix with shuffled numbers and one empty tile. you are tasked with sorting the matrix in ascending order by sliding that empty tile around inside the matrix. You can choose a difficulty at the beginning and a leaderboard is displayed on game completion. That's all!

## ðŸ”§ Build Instructions

### Requirements
The following packages are needed to compile the game. Ensure that they exist before Compiling.

- `clang` or `gcc` compiler
- `ncurses` development library
- `make` for compiling all files (optional)

### Compile

#### Compiling using makefile :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harikrishnamohann/uni-void.git
cd uni-void
make release
```

#### Compiling without makefile
I implemented a unity build system. So you can just directly compile main.c into target/
```bash
  mkdir -p ./target
  gcc -lncurses -o3 src/main.c -o target/uni-void
```

Now, an executable named uni-void should be produced inside the target directory 

### Run the game
```bash
make run
```
OR
```bash
./target/uni-void
```
